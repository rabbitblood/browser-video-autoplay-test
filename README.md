# What is this?

this repository is a simple test for test video auto play in
variety of devices and browsers.
mainly to test the video auto play in mobile devices and Wechat browser with Next.js.

this project is inspired when I have struggled to make the video auto play in Wechat browser in mobile devices. So I decide to make a repository to test the video auto play in different in-app browsers and mobile devices.

## How to test

1.open demo website in your testing browser

[https://wechat-browser-video-autoplay-test.vercel.app/](https://wechat-browser-video-autoplay-test.vercel.app/)

2.test with local server

```bash

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
